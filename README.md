# VR Lab

## Overview

This project is a collaborative research initiative between the Psychology, Neuroscience, and Computer Science departments at Baldwin Wallace University. Our goal is to develop realistic 3D environments using the Unity Engine to study fear conditioning and fear extinction in a controlled virtual setting. By leveraging VR technology, we aim to provide new insights into how fear responses can be triggered and diminished over time.

## Features

- Realistic 3D Environments: Built using Unity with assets from the Unity Asset Store.

- Eye & Camera Tracking: Utilizes the HTC VIVE Pro Eye to gather precise tracking data.

- SimpleOmnia Integration: Developed by Justin Kasowski, SimpleOmnia accelerates development and enhances our ability to collect eye-tracking and camera-tracking data efficiently.

- Fear Conditioning & Extinction Models: Designed to simulate real-world scenarios that induce and measure fear responses.

## Technology Stack

- Game Engine: [Unity](https://unity.com/)

- VR Hardware: HTC VIVE Pro Eye

- Data Collection: [SimpleOmnia](https://github.com/simpleOmnia/sXR?tab=readme-ov-file)

- SDKs & Libraries: SteamVr, [SRanipal](https://docs.vrcft.io/docs/v4.0/hardware/VIVE/sranipal)

- Programming Languages: C#, Unity Scripts

## Collaboration: GitHub for version control and project management

- Installation & Setup

  - Clone the repository:

  - git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/VR-LAB.git
    
  - cd VR-Lab
    
  - Open the project in Unity (recommended version: 2023.1.5f1).

  - Ensure that the HTC VIVE Pro Eye is properly set up and recognized by SteamVR and SRanipal if using eyetracking.

  - Install SimpleOmnia package following the [instructions](https://github.com/simpleOmnia/sXR/wiki/Installation) provided by Justin Kasowski.

  - Run the project and start experimenting!
